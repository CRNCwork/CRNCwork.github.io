## It's Just Week 6 of a LONG 52-Week Personal Development Syllabus

Every week counts ... especially the previous couple of weeks ... we want to get it really right, while it's still fresh,because of how discipline builds.

When we ***return*** our foundations, we can finally begin to actually **build** on them ... it's like how it works after we have grown up, when we can let go of any resentments and respect our parents ***more*** ... *we don't have to make the silly effort to rebelliously make fun of the old fogey's who are still clinging to their outdated beliefs* -- we can finally join them in their wisdom and maybe even build from there.

For Week 6, we start, as we did last week, by looking back at the previous week ... or two or three... and, if necessary we go back futher, IMPROVING and BUILDING on whatever came before to provided the foundation for that week. 

Yes. It is repitious. The repetition is necessary and important, because it's not just about the current week -- ***we are building a long term discipline.***

### Flexible vs. rigid scheduling: finding YOUR balance

### Analyzing personal productivity metrics

### Refining personal mission statement based on values

### Practicing mono-tasking for improved focus

### Cognitive restructuring for procrastination thoughts

### Implementing weekly review and planning sessions

### Journaling for metacognitive awareness

You probably cannot journal enough ... but, let the need to write somethng down guide you ... journaling time is on an AS-NEEDED basis or possibly when you are on-hold waiting for someone that you need to talk with ... it's not really intended to be scheduled [throughout the day], except maybe for a Gratitude Journal for waking up ... and an EXAMEN journal daily review at the end of the day.
