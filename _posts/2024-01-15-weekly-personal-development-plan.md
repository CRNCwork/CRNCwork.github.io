# It's Just Week 3 of a LONG 52-Week Personal Development Syllabus

Every week counts ... especially the previous couple of weeks ... we want to get it really right, while it's still fresh,because of how discipline builds.

When we ***return*** our foundations, we can finally begin to actually **build** on them ... it's like how it works after we have grown up, when we can let go of any resentments and respect our parents ***more*** ... *we don't have to make the silly effort to rebelliously make fun of the old fogey's who are still clinging to their outdated beliefs* -- we can finally join them in their wisdom and maybe even build from there.

For Week 3, we start, as we did last week, by looking back at the previous week ... or two ... and, if necessary, BUILDING on whatever came before to provided the foundation for that Week. The repetition is necessary and important, because it's not just about the current week -- ***we are building a long term discipline.***

### Refining time blocks based on energy levels

What does your Examen Journal say about your energy levels?

If you don't have an Examen Journal, what is your device for tracking your energy levels?

### Introducing the Pomodoro / Flowmodoro Techniques for time management

15 hour day = 30 Pomodoro time blocks ... each block is 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute HIIT exercisebreak.

### Aligning daily tasks with core values

Who is paying you to sit? Why are you sitting? Why are you doing what you are doing AND why are you doing it the way you are doing it? Who is paying you to sit? Who's going to compensate you for the atrophy of your body because you were sitting around. Why are there chairs in your house?

### Creating a distraction-free work environment

Before you waste much time CREATING it, you had better have a plan for how are you going to SUSTAIN that distraction-free work environment, right? 

Is your plan to hire a maid? Maybe you think you can get a robotic work area cleaning maid? Is the mechanism going to be expensive and require routine maintenance and repair like a snowblower or lawnmower? Is it loud and obnoxious like a lawnmower or snowblower?

### The D.F.U.Z. Technique for procrastination, burnout, depression, and other disruptions to your productivity

Distinguish between perception and perspective

Force yourself to do the best that you can to "eat the frog" 

Upcycle your lesson into discipline to improve FUTURE uptime

Zone yourself into a productive state of flow ... sustain the ZONE, act like you are in a state of flow, "fake it until you make it" ... and, when it's just not working, get out your Examen Journal and write down your excuses and the reasons for what seems to be driving your lack of productivity ... getting in the ZONE will come out of your Examen Journal DISCIPLINE when you review what you have written and come back to UNDERSTANDING that LACK of being in the ZONE.

### Breaking down goals into actionable steps

A goal has to start with a VISION of a SMART objective ... that's WHY you are doing the goal and the WHY of that goal has to map into your BIG WHY. 

Sometimes you need to get into the process of working on your goal ... to understand that you need to break it down MORE or to break it down DIFFERENTLY into actionable steps.

### Basic Christian mindfulness meditation practice

RETURN to the 4-7-8 breathwork ... in the name of the Father ... and of the Son ... and of the Holy Spirit ... complete this mindful diaphramatic breathing exercise 30 times ... each time starting with the intention to let go of OTHER CARES AND CONCERNS, to be open to the presence of God ... 

Use the breathwork practice to clear the mind ... when the mind just will not stay clear, use the Examen Journal to help you understand the reasons for your lack of mindfulness ... and to help you understand how to improve your mindfulness.
