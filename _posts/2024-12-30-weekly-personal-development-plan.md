This week is for just strictly for celebration and joy!

But, of course, things will cross our minds ... we'll take note and find a place for them in the New Year ... and that might necessitate shuffling the plan a bit rather than just re-using and freshening up the last year's content ... so we'll still be doing some personal development work ... but mostly, it's for celebration and joy.
