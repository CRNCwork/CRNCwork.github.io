### Suggested Daily Subtopic Foci:

If you are struggling with addiction to the degree that you have been involved in some embarrassing event or arrest, you are already deep into the territory where you really require professional help ... this week's Examen is really intended for amateurs who have maybe dabbled with substances years ago and fully understood why they should taper their use off to zero ... it might also be useful for others who are interested in this topic for the sake of helping a loved one who is just experimenting, but this is a very serious topic and professionals should be consulted if the usage patterns are out of control.  

In general, as we go through life, it's important for us to step back from our perceptions and to look at our behaviors from the perspective of looking at someone else who we are responsible for.  Thinking about substance abuse [if we don't use substances] is a great exercise to help us see our other sub-optimal behaviors from a different perspective, eg abusers of substances do not ever really ***see*** the larger consequences of their behaviors.
