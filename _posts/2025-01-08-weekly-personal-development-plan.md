# It's Just Week 2 of a LONG 52-Week Personal Development Syllabus

Every week counts ... especially since this week will include studying your Examen Journal, to look at where you have struggled in the previous weeks.

When we ***return*** our foundations, we can finally begin to really **build** upon them -- it is by returning to familiar foundations, we can reinforce and strengthen them.

After we have grown up, we all tend to respect our parents a lot ... *we don't have to make the effort to rebelliously make fun of the old fogey's who are still clinging to their outdated beliefs -- we can finally join them in strengthening family wisdom.*

For Week 2, we begin this Week by looking back at the previous week ... and, if necessary, BUILDING on whatever came before to provided the foundation for that Week.

### Re-initializing

Starting with what we have learned from last year ... or even trying to *tear up the script* and start over ... it's going to be about *re-*creating your *"brand new"* first-week-of-the-year schedule with time blocks ... look at the big picture ... what are your goals and SMART OBJECTIVES for this year?  {HINT: If you don't have SMART objectives and written goals for yourself, it's time to start doing that!}

### Time audit: tracking current time usage

### Defining personal and professional values

### Attention assessment: identifying major distractors and the Examen Journal

### Examen Journaling is more than just a procrastination log or documenting your avoidance tricks or maladaptive behaviors

### Setting and PDCAing initial short-term and long-term goals

### Reviewing and re-implementing all of the material that you have learned about written to goal setting and SMART criteria.

### Re-introduction to Catholic catechism and its relevance to self-control
