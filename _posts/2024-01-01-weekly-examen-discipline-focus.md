This extended list provides an EXAMPLE of a comprehensive framework for your year of intense focus. Itâ€™s not YOUR example, so you have to make it yours by adapting it to your unique needs and priorities. As you progress through your list of Examen topics each year, you will need to be open to new insights and discoveries about yourself and your true calling â€¦ so that when you work on your Examen process in the following year, you can be more diligent and precisely focused on your needs and Godâ€™s particular unique expectations for your life.

This deep inner work is a powerful journey of transformation. Be patient with yourself, ie you will fail and there will be times when you fill inadequate or not really up to the demands of leading your life, but donâ€™t give in to the temptation to second-guess your Creator â€¦ celebrate your struggles, failures, doubts and you might even boldly, but privately take some of the credit for your progress â€¦ trust that you will LEAD a life of greater purpose, fulfillment, and authenticity.
