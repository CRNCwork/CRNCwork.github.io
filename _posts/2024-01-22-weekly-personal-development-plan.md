# It's Just Week 4 of a LONG 52-Week Personal Development Syllabus

Every week counts ... especially the previous couple of weeks ... we want to get it really right, while it's still fresh,because of how discipline builds.

When we ***return*** our foundations, we can finally begin to actually **build** on them ... it's like how it works after we have grown up, when we can let go of any resentments and respect our parents ***more*** ... *we don't have to make the silly effort to rebelliously make fun of the old fogey's who are still clinging to their outdated beliefs* -- we can finally join them in their wisdom and maybe even build from there.

For Week 4, we start, as we did last week, by looking back at the previous week ... or two ... and, if necessary we go back futher, IMPROVING and BUILDING on whatever came before to provided the foundation for that week. 

Yes. It is repitious. The repetition is necessary and important, because it's not just about the current week -- ***we are building a long term discipline.***

### Experimenting with different scheduling techniques

### Time journaling: reflecting on productivity patterns

It's the REFLECTION that counts!

### Value-based decision making in daily choices

Get into the HABIT of asking whether you are using this time that is consistent with the values that you want to be known for.

And get used to getting sidetracked ... by all kinds of things ... and, when you do, use tools/practices like your Examen Journal to help you understand why you got sidetracked and how to avoid getting sidetracked in the future.

Your values MATTER ... and one of your values has to be humility or about what you are going to do to overcome backsliding and slipping back into bad habits that you should leave behind.

### Mindful technology usage to reduce distractions

### DFUZ and even better DFUZ-ing

Identifying emotional triggers for procrastination

DFUZ your DFUZ-ing process ... and accelerate your DFUZ-ing even more.

### RE-Introduction to PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle

Build feedback loops into your time management and goal setting processes. Feedback, self-coaching and repetition is key to building self-discipline.

Not just DFUZ ... OODA your OODA loop ... practice metacognition jiujitsu

Use D.O.W.N.T.I.M.E. to learn to see waste in your time management and goal setting skills.

* What ***DEFECTS*** did you produce with the last time block? A DEFECT is anything that is not the optimal it could be.
* What did you ***OVERPRODUCE*** or ***OVERPROMISE*** or ***OVERPOLISH***?
* When did you settle for ***WAITING*** and fidgeting like a stressed, spoilt anxious brat RATHER than mindfully praying until you were required to act?
* Why are you ***NULLIFYING*** blessings through ingratitude? Why do you ***NEGATE*** ideas before you've even heard them out? Why do you choose ******NOT*** to listen or ***NOT*** to ask others for suggestions, inputs, comments?
* Why are you ***TRANSPORTING*** yourself and a couple tons of vehicle weight around driving places or shopping for things? Who is paying you to sit while your ***TRANSPORTATION*** assets hauls your assets around? Who's paying you to be a passenger OR to be an owner and maintainer of rapidly depreciating ***TRANSPORTATION*** asset that requires insurance, maintenance, fuel and all kinds of expense, time and attention?
* Why are you adding to your ***INVENTORIES*** of stuff? Why are you increasing your need for more ***INVENTORY*** storage property and expense?
* Why are you exercising and ***MOVING*** in ways that optimize your health and longevity? You don't need to add junk repititions, but you should look at which muscle groups and capabilities are atrophying? Why do you use ***MACHINES*** rather work on your functional fitness through things like housework, yardwork, snow shoveling or walking to run errands? It's not exactly about moving or not moving, but the quality and ***lack of MINDFULNESS*** in your movement patterns that matters.
* Ditch your ***EGO!*** Get rid of anything you do strictly for the sake of appearances, for conforming to the ***EXPECTATIONS*** of ego-filled idiots. Stop caring about what others think -- start caring about your own thinking processes.

### Self-reflection on spiritual growth and Catholic teachings

Appreciate your faith even more ... if you feel like your spiritual journey is not going anywhere, at least go through the motions, until you feel like it ... ask others about what they do to amp up their spiritual skillsets.

The **essence of being a SPIRITUAL warrior is to never quit** on the mission of becoming a better spiritual warrior.
